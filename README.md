# 100 Days of Code

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode repository! This project is a collection of Python programs ranging from beginner to advanced levels, organized into 100 programming files. Each program has its corresponding output stored in this [folder](/assets). This journey is a commitment to code consistently for 100 days, improving my skills and tackling a variety of coding challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows; 

- **Days 1-100:
- Each Day is listed from, `Day1` to `Day100`.
- Each files output is added in the [assets](/assets) folder.

## Getting Started 

To explore the code, simply navigate through the files based on the day. Each day's file contains a Python code and its corresponding output file in the [assets](assets) folder. You can run the Python programs locally to see the results.

## Contents 

The programs cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: 

- Introduction to Python, basic syntax, and simple programs.
- Intermediate Python concepts, data structures, and algorithms.
- Advanced python topics and more.
- Specialized topics and more.

## Running the Code

make sure you Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Clone the repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ruban2205/100DaysOfCode.git
cd 100DaysOfCode
```

Navigate to the specific day's folder and run the Python programs: 

```
python program_name.py
```
